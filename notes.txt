subject-005: C0 (CIIL) stopped well. "I like this one"
subject-006: C2 (CIIL) simultaneity was harder.
subject-009: Adaptation is nice. Gives me a boost at the end b/c I got better.
subject-011: Oracle approach catastrophically failed. Model constantly predicted supination, and pronation wasn't predicted after a certain point. This happened during validation for some reason, so the model could not recover.
